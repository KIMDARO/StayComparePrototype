# StayCompare Lite

## Overview
StayCompare Lite is a small prototype web app I built to help compare accommodation options based on total cost. The idea came from wanting a simple way to compare different stays without relying on spreadsheets or constantly switching between tabs.

I have been working on this protoype for a month so it is still fairly new and decided to upload it into my Github.

This project is intentionally lightweight and focuses on clarity, usability, and core JavaScript fundamentals rather than advanced frameworks.

## What it does
- Add accommodation options with pricing details  
- Automatically calculate total cost  
- Sort stays by price or name  
- Shortlist favourite options  
- Filter to view only shortlisted stays  
- Open listing links and quickly search for images of each place  
- Export comparisons using the browser’s print-to-PDF feature  

All data is stored locally in the browser, so nothing is uploaded or shared.

## How it’s built
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling and layout (startup-style UI)  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for logic and interactivity  
- **LocalStorage** for saving data between sessions  

No external libraries or backend services are used.

## Why I built it
I wanted to strengthen my understanding of:
- JavaScript state management  
- DOM manipulation and event handling  
- Working with arrays of objects  
- Designing simple but usable interfaces  

This project helped me practise building something end-to-end and thinking about user experience, not just code.

---

## Status
This is an **early-stage prototype**, not a finished product.  
Features, layout, and design decisions would be refined in a production version.

---

## Possible future improvements
- Image previews for stays  
- Editing existing stays  
- Mobile-first refinements  
- Backend support for multi-device access
